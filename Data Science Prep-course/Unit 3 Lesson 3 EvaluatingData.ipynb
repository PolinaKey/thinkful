    "\n",
    "Shortcomings:\n",
    "- Christmas season: areas close to Christmas market less available \n",
    "- More Hosts staying home or on the other hand travelling for Christmas and thus providing more accommodation\n",
    "- Students leaving for home / vacations - more offer in the student areas\n",
    "- Airbnb might not be a great source: Airbnb are more wide spread in the residential areas, whereas hotels more present in central areas popular with tourists\n",
    "\n",
    "To adjust: \n",
    "- Get the data on attractiveness of specific areas in Amsterdam during Christmas (or seasonality coefficients) and apply the coefficients to see the data 'cleared' from Christmas.\n",
    "- Limit conclusions to Christmas period and answer a new question: Where do Airbnb travellers prefer staying on Christmas in Amsterdam?\n"

    "- NY terrorist attack will cause a spike in mental health service in NY on that date. \n",

    "- Collect the data for the other day (not close to exceptional circumstances) \n",
    "- Identify the trend of increased usage of the other medical services on September 12 and apply the corrections\n",
    "- New question: how terrorist attack affected use of mental services in NY and SF? differences between the city where the attack happened and the city where it could have happened "
