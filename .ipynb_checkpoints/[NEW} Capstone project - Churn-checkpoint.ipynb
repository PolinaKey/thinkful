    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The following report and research proposal has the aim to analyse the data sample [available on IBM Watson website] [REFENCE] on the churn problem in a given telecommunication company and bring the insights from the data analysis. This notebook will guide the reader throught important analytical processes in order to answer the business questions in regards to churn and highlights the findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal and scope of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is an important issue for any business, since it directly impacts the market share of a company and its profitability. Predicting churn and understanding how to work with clients who are about to churn is very beneficial. For this purpose, we will bring the insights from the data that would help define the patterns shared by churning customers and help us understand better what might be a reason for the churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data we have, we'll focus primarily on giving insights about the following questions: \n",
    "1. When do clients churn? \n",
    "2. Who are these people who are churning and how different they are from non-churners? \n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the second question above we'll split the client base into various segments and analyse a few extreme profiles to find out any similarities between churning clients. Also, we're interested to characterize the customers who are happy to stay with the company for very long time and are not prone to churn. Hence, we'll analyse in particular, the following segments:\n",
    "- Clients who are not churning and have the longest tenure \n",
    "- Clients who stayed long with company and eventually churned\n",
    "- Clients who churned quickly \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data set description\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the client data found on IBM Watson from telecommunication companies [LINK]. The dataset has 7043 rows, each belonging to a single client, and 21 columns describing demographic characteristics of the customers, services used, payment patterns and their churn status. \n",
